### Hi there, I'm Vedaant 👋

Born in Delhi. I now live in New York, USA. 

I'm a 16-year-old developer and student. 

Technology can connect the world or divide it. It can clean up the world or make it still dirtier. It can make us smarter or dumb us down. 

It can save the world, or it can destroy it. 

Each of my little projects are an attempt to do the former.
