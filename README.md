### Hi there, I'm Vedaant 👋

Born in Delhi. I now live in New York, USA. 

I'm a 16-year-old developer and student. 

Technology can connect the world or divide it. It can clean up the world or make it dirtier. It can make us smarter or dumb us down. 

I try my best to use my knowledge of tech to make the world a better place.
